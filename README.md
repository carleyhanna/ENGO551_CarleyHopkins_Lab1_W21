ENGO 551 Lab 1 
This lab creates a python/flask based webpage that allows a user to log in and search for books and book reviews.
The page will eventually allow for registration, in it's current form, the login credentials are test and test.
Without logging in, the only page that can be accessed is the login page. To access any book searching, the user must log in. Any attempt to go to a different page will redirect the user.
On the postgresql database, there are tables setup to handle a user registration and the book list.
import.py is the code that will execute the upload of the book data to the database.
application.py is the execution. 
There are several html pages that handle the aesthetics of the website, titled index for the homepage, login for the login, welcome for the welcome page, and book and search for the searching and listing of the requested books.
